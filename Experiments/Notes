# Quick Notes on the approach: 

## About Epistemic Uncertainty
    Q1: Why computing epistemic uncertainty this way ? (variance over the different predicted probabilities)
    Alternative: See the probabilities output by our model, and maybe this is a way of quantifying the confidence with 
    which our model predicts the class of an input. 
    Proposed Answer: Computing the uncertainty this way allows to differentiate the epistemic uncertainty 
    from the aleatoric uncertainty. 

## About the general approach
    Q1: Why do we try to detect OOD points this way? 
    Alternative: Use GANs or VAEs in order to learn a generative model for the distribution
    and then be able to detect OOD points from our generative model
    Proposed Answer: For GANs, the training seems complicated. + what will happen with the OOD 
    points ? Still unclear how we would encode the variety of different models that come from the posterior
    distribution.  
    
## About pymc3
    - pymc3 and matplotlib are not compatible. We need to separate their use in different files. 
    What we could do is save a MCMC sample on a text file and then use it afterwards for decision.
