## About Epistemic Uncertainty
    Q1: Why computing epistemic uncertainty this way ? (variance over the different predicted probabilities)
    Alternative: See the probabilities output by our model, and maybe this is a way of quantifying the confidence with 
    which our model predicts the class of an input. 
    Proposed Answer: Computing the uncertainty this way allows to differentiate the epistemic uncertainty 
    from the aleatoric uncertainty.
